```

2. Create Stripe Connect application at https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings

- Click at 'Connect' Tab
- Select the 'Platform Settings'
- fill in the webSite info and the callback_url
  - Make sure that redirect URI is set to actual OAuth 2.0 callback URL, usually http://path_to_opauth/stripeconnect/int_callback

## Strategy configuration
Required parameters:

```php
<?php
'StripeConnect' =>
  ['client_id' => 'YOUR_STRIPE_CONNECT_CLIENT KEY',

Even though scope is an optional configuration parameter for Opauth-Stripe-Connect, for most cases you would like to explicitly define it.
